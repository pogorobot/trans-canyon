It is December 28, 2015. Leelah Alcorn has been dead for one year. The world is not yet fixed.

You, a spiky plant, look out upon Trans Canyon, and you wonder. You have thoughts. You have desires. You have fears. Your fears have fears. You will begin to peel back those layers tonight.

This is for the ghosts of the past, and the memories of the future.
